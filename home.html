                    <p>I am a current Master's student at the University of Southern California. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in <strong>computer science</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I became interested in computer science during my first year as an applied and computational mathematics major. This has grown into a greater passion that combines the technical skills I have learned in class with my personal love for web design.</p>
                    <p>Over the past year, I have discovered a passion for data science. I am taking an online course to build my skills and am looking for roles to apply what I've learned!</p>
                    <p>I recently completed my 2021 summer internship at AT&T as a technical business manager. I worked with the AT&T TV video team, and I learned more about the product development process.</p>
                    <p>I was a web developer intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Public Engagement team. I am grateful for this opportunity to work with a driven team and learn how to apply what I have learned in class thus far. Additionally, I am thankful to have joined at such an exciting time for JPL!</p>
