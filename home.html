                    <p>I am a current Master's student at the University of Southern California. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in <strong>computer science</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I became interested in computer science during my first year as an applied and computational mathematics major. This has grown into a greater passion that combines the technical skills I have learned in class with my personal love for web design.</p>
                    <p>Over the past year, I have discovered a passion for data science. I am taking an online course to build my skills and am looking for roles to apply what I've learned!</p>
                    <p>In addition to my interests in data and machine learning, I also have a love of teaching. My experiences include an undergraduate teaching assistant at USC and an elementary school science enrichment teacher with STAR Education. My long term goals include combining my love of computer science/data analytics with my love of teaching to create a free, robust, and inclusive program for underrepresented students in STEM. If this is something you're interested in hearing more about, please reach out!</p>
                    <p>I recently completed my 2021 summer internship at AT&T as a technical business manager. I worked with the AT&T TV video team, and I learned more about the product development process.</p>
                    <p>I was a web developer intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Public Engagement team. I am grateful for this opportunity to work with a driven team and learn how to apply what I have learned in class thus far. Additionally, I am thankful to have joined at such an exciting time for JPL!</p>
